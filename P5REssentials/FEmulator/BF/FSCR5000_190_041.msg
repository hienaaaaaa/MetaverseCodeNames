[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]Who do the Shadows riding on the trains[n]belong to?[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]Since this place is the Palace of the[n]public, it wouldn't be a shock to see[n]that appear as a cognition.[n][w][e]
[s][bup 0 3 0 0 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]Either way, they don't seem to be[n]interested in attacking us. We can[n]probably just ignore them.[n][w][e]
