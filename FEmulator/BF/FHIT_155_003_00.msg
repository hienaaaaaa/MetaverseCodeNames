[s]It looks like a boulder will come rolling[n]down every time we try go to up here.[n][w][e]
[s]We won't be able to move on like this.[n]Let's search the nearby areas for the time[n]being.[n][w][e]

[s]Hm, this looks like a switch of some kind...[n]Should we try pressing it?[n][w][e]

[msg D04_155_003_GIM01_CLEAR__2 [Queen]]
[s]What was that...? Quite a few boulders[n]just rolled down...[n][w][e]
[s]We should go see if anything has changed.[n][w][e]
