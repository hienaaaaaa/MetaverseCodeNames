[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]I wonder if there's something special[n]about it. Should we take a closer look[n]just in case?[n][w][e]

[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]They're great. Not only do they give you[n]a lot of experience, they might be useful[n]for your Personas too.[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]However, they run very fast, and attacks[n]don't deal very much damage to them.[n][w][e]
